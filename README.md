# Perzeptron

This work was implemented as a laboratory work for ITMO University, St. Petersburg, Russia

In this project, a simple neural network is developed based on the perceptron model. The network specializes in identifying handwritten numbers.
The perceptron receives 784 nodes as input, contains 100 hidden nodes and 10 output nodes.

The principle model of the perceptron is shown in the image below, which shows the input, hidden and output layers and the propagation paths of the "signal".

In the image below, you can see an example of an image being processed by a neural network.

Also implemented is a neural network efficiency check, which is still sad, but I will fix it over time
